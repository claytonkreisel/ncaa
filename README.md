# NCAA School Information Lookup

This was the first small application I did using React.js. I didn't spend a lot of time on bells and whistles. I simply wanted to play around with the virtual dom and comeup with a workflow for building a React.js based web app. My goals were to learn to do the following:

## Goals

1. Learn how to use components (classes and functional)
2. Learn how to `fetch` data from an API
3. Learn about states and props
4. Get familiar with syntax and conventions of React.js
5. Play around with the virtualDOM a little bit
6. Learn how to do event handling
7. Establish a workflow and gather needed tools (PrePros is what I used for the compiling)
